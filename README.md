This projects aims to use linear regression model to predict gage, discharge and precipitation of a node in the river system by using two other nodes located above this node. The proper documentation of how this is done is explained in the source/sigspatial.pdf. The python file uses the data provided in the csv files to predict future values. We aim to use more complicated regression models in the future after the linear regression model script works siffuciently well. The linear_reg.docx provides a explanation of how linear regression models are modelled and used.
